#What does SQL stand for?#

* Structured Query Language

#What is a relational database?#

#What type of structure does a relational database work with?#

* 

***What is a ‘schema’?***

* a schema is a list of logical structures of data

***What is a NoSQL database?***

* non-relational or distributed database.

***How does it work?***

* NoSQL gives you a way to work with data closer to the application. It is a modern data storage paradigm that provides data persistence for environments where high performance is the primary requirement. Within a NoSQL database, data is stored so that both writing and reading are fast, even under heavy load.

***What is inside of a Mongo database?***

* Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.

***Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.***

* MongoDB is more fast and scalable in comparison to the SQL server

***What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?***

* Not all NoSQL databases contemplate the atomicity of instructions and the integrity of the data. They withstand what's know as eventual consistence.
Compatibility issues with SQL instructions. 
Lack of standarization. 
Cross-platform support. 
Poor usability
