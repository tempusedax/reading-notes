## Growth Mindset
- Get out of your conformt zone 
- Everything is an oppurtunity to advance and grow.
- Grit is sticking with your future day in and day out. 

- An area in emotional intelligence I would like to improve is probably communicating emotional topics. The world is a terrible place most likely because it is filled with terrible people. I dont know how to articulate that point to those people in a positive way.
- Bias is interesting and seemingly antiquated. It reminds me of when someone cheats, so people respond with ways that have cheated to assuage the cheater, instead of actively attempting to assist the victim of said cheater. Its just an interesting take for me. Bias exists, but there is a difference between me wanting to work for a specific group of people and you not wanting that group to work at all. There are many levels to bias but the most talked about aspects seem to be miles away.
