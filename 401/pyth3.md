## Classes.

- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity;
- Objects get their variables and functions from classes;
- Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
- dot notation
- The __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for asigning values in a class.Think self in JS

## What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

## Need of Recursion
- A data structure is recursive if it can be deÔ¨Åned in terms of a smaller version of itsel
- A list is an example of a recursive data structure


## Testing
- In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition
- Ensure as close to 100% coverage as possible
-

## Things I want to know more about
- Multiple assertions for a singular function
