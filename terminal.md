# Terminal practice and overall competence.

-Overall understanding of command line. Navigating the working tree is easy as well as movin stuff around. The only issue is bash location.
-I still dont understand bash completely. When downloading/changing stuff it can get lost because of how it was downloaded or where it is housed.
-I dont know how to rewrite the bash paths or direct specific paths to get that working. Everything else is pretty basic.
